Beyond defining the functions to run the program, I did not have any set mindset going
into this assignment. After hours upon ours in Sennott Square trying to figure this
assignment out, my mindset changed to better understand the importance of loops and
splitting values in a file. After acquiring the correct data from these files, I wanted
to use formatting tools to put into my printKV function to provide the correct output for
the user.
